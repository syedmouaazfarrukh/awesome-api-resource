# Authentication Guide

Welcome to the Authentication guide for the [Your Project/Repository Name] API! In this guide, we'll cover the important topic of authentication, which ensures that only authorized users can access your API resources.

## Why Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, application, or system. It prevents unauthorized access and ensures that only legitimate users can interact with your API. Proper authentication is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of your data.

## Types of Authentication

### API Keys

API keys are simple and widely used for authentication. They're unique tokens issued to users or applications, and they're included in API requests to identify the sender. API keys are often used for public APIs.

### OAuth

OAuth (Open Authorization) is a more complex authentication protocol suitable for both user-to-service and service-to-service scenarios. It allows users to grant permissions to third-party applications to access their resources without sharing sensitive credentials.

## Steps for API Key Authentication

1. **Obtain API Key:** Register for an API key in the developer portal.
2. **Include API Key:** Add the API key as a parameter in the request headers.
3. **Validate Key:** On the server side, validate the key before processing the request.

## Steps for OAuth Authentication

1. **Register Application:** Create an OAuth application in your account settings.
2. **Get Access Token:** Users authenticate and grant access to your application, which returns an access token.
3. **Include Access Token:** Include the access token in API requests to identify the user.

## Conclusion

Authentication is a crucial aspect of API security. Implementing the right authentication method ensures that your API is accessible only by authorized users or applications. As you build and secure your API, make sure to choose the appropriate authentication approach based on your project's requirements.
