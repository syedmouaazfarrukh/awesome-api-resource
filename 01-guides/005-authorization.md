# Authorization Guide

Welcome to the Authorization guide for the [Your Project/Repository Name] API! In this guide, we'll delve into the concept of authorization, which controls what authenticated users or applications can do with your API resources.

## Why Authorization?

Authorization defines the permissions and actions that an authenticated user or application is allowed to perform within your API. It ensures that users can only access or modify the resources they have the right to interact with.

## Types of Authorization

### Role-Based Authorization

Role-based authorization assigns different roles (e.g., admin, user, moderator) to users. Each role has specific permissions, and users can perform actions based on their assigned role.

### Token-Based Authorization

Token-based authorization involves issuing tokens to users upon successful authentication. These tokens contain information about the user's permissions and are used to grant access to specific resources.

## Steps for Role-Based Authorization

1. **Define Roles:** Identify the different roles and their associated permissions.
2. **Assign Roles:** Assign roles to users based on their level of access.
3. **Check Permissions:** Before allowing an action, check if the user's role has the necessary permissions.

## Steps for Token-Based Authorization

1. **Authenticate User:** Ensure the user is authenticated and obtain an access token.
2. **Check Token:** Examine the token to determine the user's permissions.
3. **Authorize Action:** Before performing an action, check if the user's token allows the specific operation.

## Conclusion

Authorization ensures that authenticated users only have access to the appropriate resources and actions within your API. As you design your authorization system, consider the level of granularity you need and the complexity of your application's requirements.
