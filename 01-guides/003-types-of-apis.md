# Types of APIs Guide

Welcome to the Types of APIs guide for the [Your Project/Repository Name] API! In this guide, we'll explore the different categories of APIs, each serving specific purposes and use cases.

## 1. Open APIs (Public APIs)

Open APIs, also known as Public APIs, are publicly available for developers and third-party applications. They offer access to certain features or data and allow developers to create applications that interact with a service.

Example: Twitter API, Google Maps API

## 2. Internal APIs (Private APIs)

Internal APIs are used within organizations to enhance communication between different teams, departments, or services. They help maintain consistency and streamline processes by allowing different software components to interact.

Example: APIs used within a company's internal software systems.

## 3. Partner APIs

Partner APIs are intended for specific external parties, usually business partners, to access certain functionalities or data. They require proper authentication and access control to ensure security.

Example: Payment gateway APIs used by e-commerce platforms.

## 4. Composite APIs

Composite APIs are APIs that provide a higher level of functionality by combining multiple endpoints or services into a single API. They simplify interactions by reducing the number of API calls needed.

Example: An API that aggregates data from different sources and presents it as a single resource.

## 5. RESTful APIs

RESTful APIs adhere to the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). They use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions on resources and are widely used due to their simplicity and scalability.

Example: Many modern web APIs, including social media platforms.
